Hello.  My name is John Dulin.  I recently graduated from Case Western Reserve University
with a degree in Physics.  I am a hacker by habit and trade and am particularly
interested in robotics, functional programming, startups, and
cosmic topology searches.  As this website is developed more writings
on these topics and my projects in them will be posted.

If you would like to talk about any of these topics, my projects, or hiring me, 
feel free to email me at dulinjd at GMail.

<p>  
Hello.  My name is John Dulin.  
</p>

<!-- I recently graduated from Case Western Reserve University 
with a degree in Physics.  I am a hacker by habit and trade and am particularly 
interested in robotics, functional programming, startups, and 
cosmic topology searches.  As this website is developed more writings 
on these topics and my projects in them will be posted.

If you would like to talk about any of these topics, my projects, or hiring me, 
feel free to email me at dulinjd at GMail. -->
